I completed my Bachelor of Economics at [Guangdong University of Foreign Studies](https://english.gdufs.edu.cn) studying International Economy and Trade in <b>JUN 2020</b>. I won the <b>Outstanding Student Scholarship</b> and <b>Merit Student</b> for <b>three</b> consecutive academic years.

Currently, I am a <b>digital marketer</b> at a game company, with extensive experience in <b>data analysis</b> and <b>technical implementation</b>. Over the past three years, I have promoted mobile games using various digital channels and used data analysis to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and optimize them. I can bring about <b>25 million</b> in revenue for the company annually.

Now, I am seeking to gain admittance into a <b>master's program in CS</b> that is available to people with different academic backgrounds. I hope to further enhance my skills and knowledge and continue to add value to my future career. I believe my background in both business and technology will provide a useful foundation for my future studies and research.
