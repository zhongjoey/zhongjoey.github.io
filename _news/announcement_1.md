As a digital marketer, I have gained valuable experience working with data and analyzing it to inform my decision-making and strategy. Therefore, I am very interested in <b>Big Data</b> and want to further study this field.
More specific research interests of mine include <b>Data analysis, Big Data Visualization, and Social Network Mining</b>.

In addition, I am also very interested in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, as I believe that AI-powered advertising will be a trend in digital marketing in the future.
