As a digital marketer, I have gained valuable experience working with data and analyzing it to inform my decision-making and strategy. Therefore, I am very interested in Big Data and want to further study this field.
More specific research interests of mine include Data analysis, Big Data Visualization, and Social Network Mining.

In addition, I am also very interested in Artificial Intelligence, as I believe that AI-powered advertising will be a trend in digital marketing in the future.
